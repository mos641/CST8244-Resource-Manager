# CST8244 Resource Manager
Built two programs, myController and myDevice. The programs run independently from each other and synchronize by installing a device driver (resource manager) from myDevice within the VM.  
The device status is visible to myController by reading from the device, or by receiving pulses from the device.  
Built for and deployed to a QNX Neutrino RTOS Virtual Machine.
